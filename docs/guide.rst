Brick User Guide

.. contents:: `Table of Contents`

Introduction
============

``brick`` is a Haskell library for programming terminal user interfaces.
Its main goal is to make terminal user interface development as painless
and as direct as possible. ``brick`` builds on `vty`_; `vty` provides
the terminal input and output interface and drawing primitives,
while ``brick`` builds on those to provide a high-level application
abstraction and combinators for expressing user interface layouts.

This documentation is intended to provide a high-level overview of
the library's design along with guidance for using it, but details on
specific functions can be found in the Haddock documentation.

The process of writing an application using ``brick`` entails writing
two important functions:

- A *drawing function* that turns your application state into a
  specification of how your interface should look, and
- An *event handler* that takes your application state and an input
  event and decides whether to change the state or quit the program.

We write drawing functions in ``brick`` using an extensive set of
primitives and combinators to place text on the screen, set its
attributes (e.g. foreground color), and express layout constraints (e.g.
padding, centering, box layouts, scrolling viewports, etc.).

These functions get packaged into a structure that we hand off to the
``brick`` library's main event loop. We'll cover that in detail in `The
App Type`_.

Installation
------------

``brick`` can be installed in the "usual way," either by installing
the latest `Hackage`_ release or by cloning the GitHub repository and
building locally.

To install from Hackage::

   $ cabal update
   $ cabal install brick

To clone and build locally::

   $ git clone https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick.git
   $ cd brick
   $ cabal sandbox init
   $ cabal install -j

Building the Demonstration Programs
-----------------------------------

``brick`` includes a large collection of feature-specific demonstration
programs. These programs are not built by default but can be built by
passing the ``demos`` flag to ``cabal install``, e.g.::

   $ cabal install brick -f demos

Conventions
===========

``brick`` has some API conventions worth knowing about as you read this
documentation and as you explore the library source and write your own
programs.

- Use of `microlens`_ packages: ``brick`` uses ``microlens`` family of
  packages internally and also exposes lenses for many types in the
  library. However, if you prefer not to use the lens interface in your
  program, all lens interfaces have non-lens equivalents exported by
  the same module. In general, the "``L``" suffix on something tells
  you it is a lens; the name without the "``L``" suffix is the non-lens
  version. You can get by without using ``brick``'s lens interface but
  your life will probably be much more pleasant once your application
  state becomes sufficiently complex if you use lenses to modify it (see
  `appHandleEvent: Handling Events`_).
- Attribute names: some modules export attribute names (see `How
  Attributes Work`_) associated with user interface elements. These tend
  to end in an "``Attr``" suffix (e.g. ``borderAttr``). In addition,
  hierarchical relationships between attributes are documented in
  Haddock documentation.
- Use of qualified Haskell identifiers: in this document, where
  sensible, I will use fully-qualified identifiers whenever I mention
  something for the first time or whenever I use something that is
  not part of ``brick``. Use of qualified names is not intended to
  produce executable examples, but rather to guide you in writing your
  ``import`` statements.

The App Type
============

To use the library we must provide it with a value of type
``Brick.Main.App``. This type is a record type whose fields perform
various functions:

.. code:: haskell

   data App s e n =
       App { appDraw         :: s -> [Widget n]
           , appChooseCursor :: s -> [CursorLocation n] -> Maybe (CursorLocation n)
           , appHandleEvent  :: s -> e -> EventM n (Next s)
           , appStartEvent   :: s -> EventM n s
           , appAttrMap      :: s -> AttrMap
           , appLiftVtyEvent :: Event -> e
           }

The ``App`` type is parameterized over three types. These type variables
will appear in the signatures of many library functions and types. They
are:

- The **application state type** ``s``: the type of data that will
  evolve over the course of the application's execution. Your
  application will provide the library with its starting value and event
  handling will transform it as the program executes. When a ``brick``
  application exits, the final application state will be returned.
- The **event type** ``e``: the type of events that your event
  handler (``appHandleEvent``) will handle. The underlying ``vty``
  library provides ``Graphics.Vty.Event`` and this forms the basis
  of all events we will handle with ``brick`` applications. The
  ``Brick.Main.defaultMain`` function expects an ``App s Event n``
  since this is a common case. Applications with higher levels of
  sophistication will need to use their own events; in that case Vty's
  ``Event`` will need to be embedded in the custom event type. ``brick``
  does this by calling ``appLiftVtyEvent``. For more details, see `Using
  Your Own Event Type`_.
- The **widget name type** ``n``: during application execution we need a
  way to refer to widgets by name. Whether it's to distinguish two
  cursor position requests, make changes to a scrollable viewport, or
  any other situation where we need a unique handle to a given widget
  state, some data type is needed. ``brick`` applications require you to
  provide that type for ``n``.  For more details, see `Widget Names`_.

The various fields of ``App`` will be described in the sections below.

To run an ``App``, we pass it to ``Brick.Main.defaultMain`` or
``Brick.Main.customMain`` along with an initial application state value.

appDraw: Drawing an Interface
-----------------------------

The value of ``appDraw`` is a function that turns the current
application state into a list of *layers* of type ``Widget``, listed
topmost first, that will make up the interface. Each ``Widget`` gets
turned into a ``vty`` layer and the resulting layers are drawn to the
terminal.

The ``Widget`` type is the type of *drawing instructions*.  The body of
your drawing function will use one or more drawing functions to build or
transform ``Widget`` values to describe your interface. These
instructions will then be executed with respect to three things:

- The size of the terminal: the size of the terminal determines how many
  ``Widget`` values behave. For example, fixed-size ``Widget`` values
  such as text strings behave the same under all conditions (and get
  cropped if the terminal is too small) but layout combinators such as
  ``Brick.Widgets.Core.vBox`` or ``Brick.Widgets.Center.center`` use the
  size of the terminal to determine how to lay other widgets out. See
  `How Widgets and Rendering Work`_.
- The application's attribute map (``appAttrMap``): drawing functions
  requesting the use of attributes cause the attribute map to be
  consulted. See `How Attributes Work`_.
- The state of scrollable viewports: the state of any scrollable
  viewports on the *previous* drawing will be considered. For more
  details, see `Viewports`_.

The ``appDraw`` function is called when the event loop begins to draw
the application as it initially appears. It is also called right after
an event is processed by ``appHandleEvent``. Even though the function
returns a specification of how to draw the entire screen, the underlying
``vty`` library goes to some trouble to efficiently update only the
parts of the screen that have changed so you don't need to worry about
this.

Where do I find drawing functions?
**********************************

The most important module providing drawing functions is
``Brick.Widgets.Core``. Beyond that, any module in the ``Brick.Widgets``
namespace provides specific kinds of functionality.

appHandleEvent: Handling Events
-------------------------------

The value of ``appHandleEvent`` is a function that decides how to modify
the application state as a result of an event. It also decides whether
to continue program execution. The function takes the current
application state and the event and returns the *next application
state*:

.. code:: haskell

   appHandleEvent :: s -> e -> EventM n (Next s)

The ``EventM`` monad is the event-handling monad. This monad is a
transformer around ``IO``, so you are free to do I/O in this monad by
using ``liftIO``. Beyond I/O, this monad is just used to make scrolling
requests to the renderer (see `Viewports`_). Keep in mind that time
spent blocking in your event handler is time during which your UI is
unresponsive, so consider this when deciding whether to have background
threads do work instead of inlining the work in the event handler.

The ``Next s`` value describes what should happen after the event
handler is finished. We have three choices:

* ``Brick.Main.continue s``: continue executing the event loop with the
  specified application state ``s`` as the next value. Commonly this is
  where you'd modify the state based on the event and return it.
* ``Brick.Main.halt s``: halt the event loop and return the final
  application state value ``s``. This state value is returned to the
  caller of ``defaultMain`` or ``customMain`` where it can be used prior
  to finally exiting ``main``.
* ``Brick.Main.suspendAndResume act``: suspend the ``brick`` event loop
  and execute the specified ``IO`` action ``act``. The action ``act``
  must be of type ``IO s``, so when it executes it must return the next
  application state. When ``suspendAndResume`` is used, the ``brick``
  event loop is shut down and the terminal state is restored to its
  state when the ``brick`` event loop began execution. When it finishes
  executing, the event loop will be resumed using the returned state
  value. This is useful for situations where your program needs to
  suspend your interface and execute some other program that needs to
  gain control of the terminal (such as an external editor).

Widget Event Handlers
*********************

Event handlers are responsible for transforming the application state.
While you can use ordinary methods to do this such as pattern matching
and pure function calls, some widget state types such as the ones
provided by the ``Brick.Widgets.List`` and ``Brick.Widgets.Edit``
modules provide their own widget-specific event-handling functions.
For example, ``Brick.Widgets.Edit`` provides ``handleEditorEvent`` and
``Brick.Widgets.List`` provides ``handleListEvent``.

Since these event handlers run in ``EventM``, they have access to
rendering viewport states via ``Brick.Main.lookupViewport`` and the
``IO`` monad via ``liftIO``.

To use these handlers in your program, invoke them on the relevant piece
of state in your application state. In the following example we use an
``Edit`` state from ``Brick.Widgets.Edit``:

.. code:: haskell

   data Name = Edit1
   type MyState = Editor String Name

   myEvent :: MyState -> e -> EventM Name (Next MyState)
   myEvent s e = continue =<< handleEditorEvent e s

This pattern works fine when your application state has an event handler
as shown in the ``Edit`` example above, but it can become unpleasant
if the value on which you want to invoke a handler is embedded deeply
within your application state. If you have chosen to generate lenses
for your application state fields, you can use the convenience function
``handleEventLensed`` by specifying your state, a lens, and the event:

.. code:: haskell

   data Name = Edit1
   data MyState = MyState { _theEdit :: Editor String Name
                          }
   makeLenses ''MyState

   myEvent :: MyState -> e -> EventM Name (Next MyState)
   myEvent s e = continue =<< handleEventLensed s theEdit handleEditorEvent e

You might consider that preferable to the desugared version:

.. code:: haskell

   myEvent :: MyState -> e -> EventM Name (Next MyState)
   myEvent s e = do
     newVal <- handleEditorEvent e (s^.theEdit)
     continue $ s & theEdit .~ newVal

Using Your Own Event Type
*************************

Since we often need to communicate application-specific events
beyond input events to the event handler, the ``App`` type is
polymorphic over the event type ``e`` that we want to handle. If we
use ``Brick.Main.defaultMain`` to run our ``App``, we have to use
``Graphics.Vty.Event`` as our event type since ``defaultMain`` is
provided as a convenience so that no extra event type is needed. But if
our application has other event-handling needs, we need to use our own
event type.

To do this, we first define an event type:

.. code:: haskell

   data CustomEvent =
       VtyEvent Graphics.Vty.Event
       | CustomEvent1
       | CustomEvent2

Our custom event type *must* provide a constructor capable of taking
a ``Graphics.Vty.Event`` value. This allows the ``brick`` event loop
to send us ``vty`` events in the midst of our custom ones. To allow
``brick`` to do this, we provide this constructor as the value of
``appLiftVtyEvent``. This way, ``brick`` can wrap a ``vty`` event using
our custom event type and then pass it to our event handler (which takes
``CustomEvent`` values). In this case we'd set ``appLiftVtyEvent =
VtyEvent``.

Once we have set ``appLiftVtyEvent`` in this way, we also need to set up
a mechanism for getting our custom events into the ``brick`` event loop
from other threads. To do this we use a ``Control.Concurrent.Chan`` and
call ``Brick.Main.customMain`` instead of ``Brick.Main.defaultMain``:

.. code:: haskell

   main :: IO ()
   main = do
       eventChan <- Control.Concurrent.newChan
       finalState <- customMain (Graphics.Vty.mkVty Data.Default.def) eventChan app initialState
       -- Use finalState and exit

The ``customMain`` function lets us have control over how the ``vty``
library is initialized and how ``brick`` gets custom events to give to
our event handler. ``customMain`` is the entry point into ``brick`` when
you need to use your own event type.

Starting up: appStartEvent
**************************

When an application starts, it may be desirable to perform some of
the duties typically only possible when an event has arrived, such as
setting up initial scrolling viewport state. Since such actions can only
be performed in ``EventM`` and since we do not want to wait until the
first event arrives to do this work in ``appHandleEvent``, the ``App``
type provides ``appStartEvent`` function for this purpose:

.. code:: haskell

   appStartEvent :: s -> EventM n s

This function takes the initial application state and returns it in
``EventM``, possibly changing it and possibly making viewport requests.
This function is invoked once and only once, at application startup.
For more details, see `Viewports`_. You will probably just want to use
``return`` as the implementation of this function for most applications.

appChooseCursor: Placing the Cursor
-----------------------------------

The rendering process for a ``Widget`` may return information about
where that widget would like to place the cursor. For example, a text
editor will need to report a cursor position. However, since a
``Widget`` may be a composite of many such cursor-placing widgets, we
have to have a way of choosing which of the reported cursor positions,
if any, is the one we actually want to honor.

To decide which cursor placement to use, or to decide not to show one at
all, we set the ``App`` type's ``appChooseCursor`` function:

.. code:: haskell

   appChooseCursor :: s -> [CursorLocation n] -> Maybe (CursorLocation n)

The event loop renders the interface and collects the
``Brick.Types.CursorLocation`` values produced by the rendering process
and passes those, along with the current application state, to this
function. Using your application state (to track which text input box
is "focused," say) you can decide which of the locations to return or
return ``Nothing`` if you do not want to show a cursor.

We decide which location to show by looking at the name value contained
in the ``cursorLocationName`` field. The name value associated
with a cursor location will be the name used to request the cursor
position, which is usually going to be the name you passed to the
widget's constructor. This is why constructors for widgets like
``Brick.Widgets.Edit.editor`` require a name parameter. The name lets us
distinguish between many cursor-placing widgets of the same type.

``Brick.Main`` provides various convenience functions to make cursor
selection easy in common cases:

* ``neverShowCursor``: never show any cursor.
* ``showFirstCursor``: always show the first cursor request given; good
  for applications with only one cursor-placing widget.
* ``showCursorNamed``: show the cursor with the specified name or show
  no cursor if the name was not associated with any requested cursor
  position.

Widgets request cursor placement by using the
``Brick.Widgets.Core.showCursor`` combinator. For example, this widget
places a cursor on the first "``o``" in "``foo``" assocated with the
cursor name "``myCursor``". The event handler for this application would
use ``MyName`` as its name type ``n`` and would be able to pattern-match
on ``CustomName`` to match cursor requests when this widget is rendered:

.. code:: haskell

   data MyName = CustomName

   let w = showCursor CustomName (Brick.Types.Location (1, 0))
             (Brick.Widgets.Core.str "foobar")

appAttrMap: Managing Attributes
-------------------------------

In ``brick`` we use an *attribute map* to assign attibutes to elements
of the interface. Rather than specifying specific attributes when
drawing a widget (e.g. red-on-black text) we specify an *attribute name*
that is an abstract name for the kind of thing we are drawing, e.g.
"keyword" or "e-mail address." We then provide an attribute map which
maps those attribute names to actual attributes.  This approach lets us:

* Change the attributes at runtime, letting the user change the
  attributes of any element of the application arbitrarily without
  forcing anyone to build special machinery to make this configurable;
* Write routines to load saved attribute maps from disk;
* Provide modular attribute behavior for third-party components, where
  we would not want to have to recompile third-party code just to change
  attributes, and where we would not want to have to pass in attribute
  arguments to third-party drawing functions.

This lets us put the attribute mapping for an entire app, regardless of
use of third-party widgets, in one place.

To create a map we use ``Brick.AttrMap.attrMap``, e.g.,

.. code:: haskell

   App { ...
       , appAttrMap = const $ attrMap Graphics.Vty.defAttr [(someAttrName, fg blue)]
       }

To use an attribute map, we specify the ``App`` field ``appAttrMap`` as
the function to return the current attribute map each time rendering
occurs. This function takes the current application state, so you may
choose to store the attribute map in your application state. You may
also choose not to bother with that and to just set ``appAttrMap = const
someMap``.

To draw a widget using an attribute name in the map, use
``Brick.Widgets.Core.withAttr``. For example, this draws a string with a
``blue`` background:

.. code:: haskell

   let w = withAttr blueBg $ str "foobar"
       blueBg = attrName "blueBg"
       myMap = attrMap defAttr [ (blueBg, Brick.Util.bg Graphics.Vty.blue)
                               ]

For complete details on how attribute maps and attribute names work, see
the Haddock documentation for the ``Brick.AttrMap`` module. See also
`How Attributes Work`_.

Widget Names
------------

We saw above in `appChooseCursor: Placing the Cursor`_ that names are
used to describe cursor locations. Names are also used to name viewports
(see `Viewports`_). Assigning names to viewports, cursors, and widgets
allows us to distinguish between events during execution. We need some
way to associate events with the widgets that generated them, and names
give us a mechanism.

You might be wondering why we don't just use ``String`` as the name type
instead of making the application developer supply a type. In fact,
``brick`` used to use ``String`` but there were several problems with
this approach:

- Since any widget could choose its own name by using any ``String``,
  name clashes could arise if two widgets used the same name. But those
  clashes would not be easy to observe.
- String names are not amenable to safe refactoring since an "invalid"
  name could be used and silently fail to cause the desired behavior at
  runtime.
- String names are not amenable to compile-time checking when being
  matched; a custom type allows the user to do compile-time checking of
  e.g. ``case`` expressions checking names.
- Extension widgets were not forced to be polymorphic in their names,
  which breaks good abstraction boundaries if extension authors elect to
  choose their own widget names.

Although requiring the user to provide a custom name type means that
more work must be done to manage the set of possible names, this is work
that should have been done up front anyway: ``String`` names could be
allocated ad-hoc but never centrally managed, resulting in troublesome
runtime problems.

A Note of Caution
*****************

**NOTE: Unique names for all named widgets are required to ensure
that the renderer correctly tracks widget states during application
execution.** If you assign the same name to, say, two viewports, they
will both use the same viewport scrolling state! So unless you want that
and know what you are doing, use a unique name for every widget that
needs one.

Your application must provide some type of name to be used to name
widgets that need names. For simple applications with only one such
widget, you may use ``()``, but if your application has more than one
named widget, you *must* provide a type capable of assigning a unique
name value to every named widget.

How Widgets and Rendering Work
==============================

When ``brick`` renders a ``Widget``, the widget's rendering routine is
evaluated to produce a ``vty`` ``Image`` of the widget. The widget's
rendering routine runs with some information called the *rendering
context* that contains:

* The size of the area in which to draw things
* The name of the current attribute to use to draw things
* The map of attributes to use to look up attribute names
* The active border style to use when drawing borders

Available Rendering Area
------------------------

The most important element in the rendering context is the rendering
area: This part of the context tells the widget being drawn how many
rows and columns are available for it to consume. When rendering begins,
the widget being rendered (i.e. a layer returned by an ``appDraw``
function) gets a rendering context whose rendering area is the size of
the terminal. This size information is used to let widgets take up that
space if they so choose. For example, a string "Hello, world!" will
always take up one row and 13 columns, but the string "Hello, world!"
*centered* will always take up one row and *all available columns*.

How widgets use space when rendered is described in two pieces of
information in each ``Widget``: the widget's horizontal and vertical
growth policies. These fields have type ``Brick.Types.Size`` and can
have the values ``Fixed`` and ``Greedy``.

A widget advertising a ``Fixed`` size in a given dimension is a widget
that will always consume the same number of rows or columns no
matter how many it is given. Widgets can advertise different
vertical and horizontal growth policies for example, the
``Brick.Widgets.Border.hCenter`` function centers a widget and is
``Greedy`` horizontally and defers to the widget it centers for vertical
growth behavior.

These size policies govern the box layout algorithm that is at
the heart of every non-trivial drawing specification. When we use
``Brick.Widgets.Core.vBox`` and ``Brick.Widgets.Core.hBox`` to
lay things out (or use their binary synonyms ``<=>`` and ``<+>``,
respectively), the box layout algorithm looks at the growth policies of
the widgets it receives to determine how to allocate the available space
to them.

For example, imagine that the terminal window is currently 10 rows high
and 50 columns wide.  We wish to render the following widget:

.. code:: haskell

   let w = (str "Hello," <=> str "World!")

Rendering this to the terminal will result in "Hello," and "World!"
underneath it, with 8 rows unoccupied by anything. But if we wished to
render a vertical border underneath those strings, we would write:

.. code:: haskell

   let w = (str "Hello," <=> str "World!" <=> vBorder)

Rendering this to the terminal will result in "Hello," and "World!"
underneath it, with 8 rows remaining occupied by vertical border
characters ("``|``") one column wide. The vertical border widget is
designed to take up however many rows it was given, but rendering the
box layout algorithm has to be careful about rendering such ``Greedy``
widgets because they won't leave room for anything else. Since the box
widget cannot know the sizes of its sub-widgets until they are rendered,
the ``Fixed`` widgets get rendered and their sizes are used to determine
how much space is left for ``Greedy`` widgets.

When using widgets it is important to understand their horizontal and
vertical space behavior by knowing their ``Size`` values. Those should
be made clear in the Haddock documentation.

Limiting Rendering Area
-----------------------

If you'd like to use a ``Greedy`` widget but want to limit how much
space it consumes, you can turn it into a ``Fixed`` widget by using
one of the *limiting combinators*, ``Brick.Widgets.Core.hLimit`` and
``Brick.Widgets.Core.vLimit``. These combinators take widgets and turn
them into widgets with a ``Fixed`` size (in the relevant dimension) and
run their rendering functions in a modified rendering context with a
restricted rendering area.

For example, the following will center a string in 30 columns, leaving
room for something to be placed next to it as the terminal width
changes:

.. code:: haskell

   let w = hLimit 30 $ hCenter $ str "Hello, world!"

The Attribute Map
-----------------

The rendering context contains an attribute map (see `How Attributes
Work`_ and `appAttrMap: Managing Attributes`_) which is used to look up
attribute names from the drawing specification. The map originates from
``Brick.Main.appAttrMap`` and can be manipulated on a per-widget basis
using ``Brick.Widgets.Core.updateAttrMap``.

The Active Border Style
-----------------------

Widgets in the ``Brick.Widgets.Border`` module draw border characters
(horizontal, vertical, and boxes) between and around other widgets. To
ensure that widgets across your application share a consistent visual
style, border widgets consult the rendering context's *active border
style*, a value of type ``Brick.Widgets.Border.Style``, to get the
characters used to draw borders.

The default border style is ``Brick.Widgets.Border.Style.unicode``. To
change border styles, use the ``Brick.Widgets.Core.withBorderStyle``
combinator to wrap a widget and change the border style it uses when
rendering. For example, this will use the ``ascii`` border style instead
of ``unicode``:

.. code:: haskell

   let w = withBorderStyle Brick.Widgets.Border.Style.ascii $
             Brick.Widgets.Border.border $ str "Hello, world!"

How Attributes Work
===================

In addition to letting us map names to attributes, attribute maps
provide hierarchical attribute inheritance: a more specific attribute
derives any properties (e.g. background color) that it does not specify
from more general attributes in hierarchical relationship to it, letting
us customize only the parts of attributes that we want to change without
having to repeat ourselves.

For example, this draws a string with a foreground color of ``white`` on
a background color of ``blue``:

.. code:: haskell

   let w = withAttr specificAttr $ str "foobar"
       generalAttr = attrName "general"
       specificAttr = attrName "general" <> attrName "specific"
       myMap = attrMap defAttr [ (generalAttr, bg blue)
                               , (specificAttr, fg white)
                               ]

Functions ``Brick.Util.fg`` and ``Brick.Util.bg`` specify
partial attributes, and map lookups start with the desired name
(``general/specific`` in this case) and walk up the name hierarchy (to
``general``), merging partial attribute settings as they go, letting
already-specified attribute settings take precedence. Finally, any
attribute settings not specified by map lookups fall back to the map's
*default attribute*, specified above as ``Graphics.Vty.defAttr``. In
this way, if you want everything in your application to have a ``blue``
background color, you only need to specify it *once*: in the attribute
map's default attribute. Any other attribute names can merely customize
the foreground color.

In addition to using the attribute map provided by ``appAttrMap``,
the map can be customized on a per-widget basis by using the attribute
map combinators:

* ``Brick.Widgets.Core.updateAttrMap``
* ``Brick.Widgets.Core.forceAttr``
* ``Brick.Widgets.Core.withDefAttr``
* ``Brick.Widgets.Core.overrideAttr``

Viewports
=========

A *viewport* is a scrollable window onto another widget. Viewports have
a *scrolling direction* of type ``Brick.Types.ViewportType`` which can
be one of:

* ``Horizontal``: the viewport can only scroll horizontally.
* ``Vertical``: the viewport can only scroll vertically.
* ``Both``: the viewport can scroll both horizontally and vertically.

The ``Brick.Widgets.Core.viewport`` combinator takes another widget
and embeds it in a named viewport. We name the viewport so that we can
keep track of its scrolling state in the renderer, and so that you can
make scrolling requests. The viewport's name is its handle for these
operations (see `Scrolling Viewports in Event Handlers`_ and `Widget
Names`_). **The viewport name must be unique across your application.**

For example, the following puts a string in a horizontally-scrollable
viewport:

.. code:: haskell

   -- Assuming that App uses 'Name' for its names:
   data Name = Viewport1
   let w = viewport Viewport1 Horizontal $ str "Hello, world!"

A ``viewport`` specification means that the widget in the viewport will
be placed in a viewport window that is ``Greedy`` in both directions
(see `Available Rendering Area`_). This is suitable if we want the
viewport size to be the size of the entire terminal window, but if
we want to limit the size of the viewport, we might use limiting
combinators (see `Limiting Rendering Area`_):

.. code:: haskell

   let w = hLimit 5 $
           vLimit 1 $
           viewport Viewport1 Horizontal $ str "Hello, world!"

Now the example produces a scrollable window one row high and five
columns wide initially showing "Hello". The next two sections discuss
the two ways in which this viewport can be scrolled.

Scrolling Viewports in Event Handlers
-------------------------------------

The most direct way to scroll a viewport is to make *scrolling requests*
in the ``EventM`` event-handling monad. Scrolling requests ask the
renderer to update the state of a viewport the next time the user
interface is rendered. Those state updates will be made with respect
to the *previous* viewport state, i.e., the state of the viewports as
of the end of the most recent rendering. This approach is the best
approach to use to scroll widgets that have no notion of a cursor.
For cursor-based scrolling, see `Scrolling Viewports With Visibility
Requests`_.

To make scrolling requests, we first create a
``Brick.Main.ViewportScroll`` from a viewport name with
``Brick.Main.viewportScroll``:

.. code:: haskell

   -- Assuming that App uses 'Name' for its names:
   data Name = Viewport1
   let vp = viewportScroll Viewport1

The ``ViewportScroll`` record type contains a number of scrolling
functions for making scrolling requests:

.. code:: haskell

   hScrollPage        :: Direction -> EventM n ()
   hScrollBy          :: Int       -> EventM n ()
   hScrollToBeginning ::              EventM n ()
   hScrollToEnd       ::              EventM n ()
   vScrollPage        :: Direction -> EventM n ()
   vScrollBy          :: Int       -> EventM n ()
   vScrollToBeginning ::              EventM n ()
   vScrollToEnd       ::              EventM n ()

In each case the scrolling function scrolls the viewport by the
specified amount in the specified direction; functions prefixed with
``h`` scroll horizontally and functions prefixed with ``v`` scroll
vertically.

Scrolling operations do nothing when they don't make sense for the
specified viewport; scrolling a ``Vertical`` viewport horizontally is a
no-op, for example.

Using ``viewportScroll`` and the ``myViewport`` example given above, we
can write an event handler that scrolls the "Hello, world!" viewport one
column to the right:

.. code:: haskell

   myHandler :: s -> e -> EventM n (Next s)
   myHandler s e = do
       let vp = viewportScroll Viewport1
       hScrollBy vp 1
       continue s

Scrolling Viewports With Visibility Requests
--------------------------------------------

When we need to scroll widgets only when a cursor in the viewport leaves
the viewport's bounds, we need to use *visibility requests*. A
visibility request is a hint to the renderer that some element of a
widget inside a viewport should be made visible, i.e., that the viewport
should be scrolled to bring the requested element into view.

To use a visibility request to make a widget in a viewport visible, we
simply wrap it with ``visible``:

.. code:: haskell

   -- Assuming that App uses 'Name' for its names:
   data Name = Viewport1
   let w = viewport Viewport1 Horizontal $
           (visible $ str "Hello," <+> (str " world!")

This example requests that the "``myViewport``" viewport be scrolled so
that "Hello," is visible. We could extend this example with a value
in the application state indicating which word in our string should
be visible and then use that to change which string gets wrapped with
``visible``; this is the basis of cursor-based scrolling.

Note that a visibility request does not change the state of a viewport
*if the requested widget is already visible*! This important detail is
what makes visibility requests so powerful, because they can be used to
capture various cursor-based scenarios:

* The ``Brick.Widgets.Edit`` widget uses a visibility request to make its
  1x1 cursor position visible, thus making the text editing widget fully
  scrollable *while being entirely scrolling-unaware*.
* The ``Brick.Widgets.List`` widget uses a visibility request to make
  its selected item visible regardless of its size, which makes
  the list widget scrolling-unaware.

Viewport Restrictions
---------------------

Viewports impose one restriction: a viewport that is scrollable in some
direction can only embed a widget that has a ``Fixed`` size in that
direction. This extends to ``Both`` type viewports: they can only embed
widgets that are ``Fixed`` in both directions. This restriction is
because when viewports embed a widget, they relax the rendering area
constraint in the rendering context, but doing so to a large enough
number for ``Greedy`` widgets would result in a widget that is too big
and not scrollable in a useful way.

Violating this restriction will result in a runtime exception.

Implementing Your Own Widgets
=============================

``brick`` exposes all of the internals you need to implement your own
widgets. Those internals, together with ``Graphics.Vty``, can be used to
create widgets from the ground up. We start by writing a constructor
function:

.. code:: haskell

   myWidget :: ... -> Widget n
   myWidget ... =
       Widget Fixed Fixed $ do
           ...

We specify the horizontal and vertical growth policies of the widget
as ``Fixed`` in this example, although they should be specified
appropriately (see `How Widgets and Rendering Work`_). Lastly we specify
the *rendering function*, a function of type

.. code:: haskell

   render :: RenderM n Result

which is a function returning a ``Brick.Types.Result``:

.. code:: haskell

    data Result n =
        Result { image              :: Graphics.Vty.Image
               , cursors            :: [Brick.Types.CursorLocation n]
               , visibilityRequests :: [Brick.Types.VisibilityRequest]
               }

The ``RenderM`` monad gives us access to the rendering context (see `How
Widgets and Rendering Work`_) via the ``Brick.Types.getContext``
function. The context type is:

.. code:: haskell

    data Context =
        Context { ctxAttrName    :: AttrName
                , availWidth     :: Int
                , availHeight    :: Int
                , ctxBorderStyle :: BorderStyle
                , ctxAttrMap     :: AttrMap
                }

and has lens fields exported as described in `Conventions`_.

The job of the rendering function is to return a rendering result which,
at a minimum, means producing a ``vty`` ``Image``. In addition, if you
so choose, you can also return one or more cursor positions in the
``cursors`` field of the ``Result`` as well as visibility requests (see
`Viewports`_) in the ``visibilityRequests`` field. Returned visibility
requests and cursor positions should be relative to the upper-left
corner of your widget, ``Location (0, 0)``. When your widget is placed
in others, such as boxes, the ``Result`` data you returned will be
offset (as described in `Rendering Sub-Widgets`_) to result in correct
coordinates once the entire interface has been rendered.

Using the Rendering Context
---------------------------

The most important fields of the context are the rendering area fields
``availWidth`` and ``availHeight``. These fields must be used to
determine how much space your widget has to render.

To perform an attribute lookup in the attribute map for the context's
current attribute, use ``Brick.Types.attrL``.

For example, to build a widget that always fills the available width and
height with a fill character using the current attribute, we could
write:

.. code:: haskell

   myFill :: Char -> Widget n
   myFill ch =
       Widget Greedy Greedy $ do
           ctx <- getContext
           let a = ctx^.attrL
           return $ Result (Graphics.Vty.charFill a ch (ctx^.availWidthL) (ctx^.availHeightL))
                           [] []

Rendering Sub-Widgets
---------------------

If your custom widget wraps another, then in addition to rendering the
wrapped widget and augmenting its returned ``Result`` *it must also
translate the resulting cursor locations and visibility requests*.
This is vital to maintaining the correctness of cursor locations and
visbility locations as widget layout proceeds. To do so, use the
``Brick.Widgets.Core.addResultOffset`` function to offset the elements
of a ``Result`` by a specified amount. The amount depends on the nature
of the offset introduced by your wrapper widget's logic.

Widgets are not required to respect the rendering context's width and
height restrictions. Widgets may be embedded in viewports or translated
so they must render without cropping to work in those scenarios.
However, widgets rendering other widgets *should* enforce the rendering
context's constraints to avoid using more space than is available. The
``Brick.Widgets.Core.cropToContext`` function is provided to make this
easy:

.. code:: haskell

   let w = cropToContext someWidget

Widgets wrapped with ``cropToContext`` can be safely embedded in other
widgets. If you don't want to crop in this way, you can use any of
``vty``'s cropping functions to operate on the ``Result`` image as
desired.

Sub-widgets may specify specific attribute name values influencing
that sub-widget.  If the custom widget utilizes its own attribute
names but needs to render the sub-widget, it can use ``overrideAttr``
or ``mapAttrNames`` to convert its custom names to the names that the
sub-widget uses for rendering its output.

`brick` is a Haskell terminal user interface (TUI) programming toolkit.
To use it, you write a pure function that describes how your user
interface should be drawn based on your current application state and
you provide a state transformation function to handle events.

`brick` exposes a declarative API. Unlike most GUI toolkits which
require you to write a long and tedious sequence of widget creations
and layout setup, `brick` just requires you to describe your interface
using a set of declarative layout combinators. Event-handling is done by
pattern-matching on incoming events and updating your application state.

Under the hood, this library builds upon
[vty](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vty), so some knowledge of Vty
will be necessary to use this library. Brick depends on
`vty-crossplatform`, so Brick should work anywhere Vty works (Unix and
Windows). Brick releases prior to 2.0 only support Unix-based systems.

Example
-------

Here's an example interface (see `programs/ReadmeDemo.hs`):

```
joinBorders $
withBorderStyle unicode $
borderWithLabel (str "Hello!") $
(center (str "Left") <+> vBorder <+> center (str "Right"))
```

Result:

```
┌─────────Hello!─────────┐
│           │            │
│           │            │
│   Left    │   Right    │
│           │            │
│           │            │
└───────────┴────────────┘
```

Brick Discussion
----------------

There are two forums for discussing brick-related things:

1. The [Discussions page](https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick/discussions) on the github repo, and
1. The `brick-users` Google Group / e-mail list. You can subscribe
   [here](https://groups.google.com/group/brick-users).

Status
------

There are some places were I have deliberately chosen to worry about
performance later for the sake of spending more time on the design
(and to wait on performance issues to arise first). `brick` is also
something of an experimental project of mine and some aspects of the
design involve trade-offs that might not be right for your application.
Brick is not intended to be all things to all people; rather, I want it
to provide a good foundation for building complex terminal interfaces
in a declarative style to take away specific headaches of building,
modifying, and working with such interfaces, all while seeing how far we
can get with a pure function to specify the interface.

`brick` exports an extension API that makes it possible to make your own
packages and widgets. If you use that, you'll also be helping to test
whether the exported interface is usable and complete!

A note on Windows support
-------------------------

Brick supports Windows implicitly by way of Vty's Windows support.
While I don't (and can't) personally test Brick on Windows hosts,
it should be possible to use Brick on Windows. If you have any
trouble, report any issues here. If needed, we'll migrate them to the
[vty-windows](https://github.com/chhackett/vty-windows) repository if
they need to be fixed there.

Reporting bugs
--------------

Please file bug reports as GitHub issues.  For best results:

 - Include the versions of relevant software packages: your terminal
   emulator, `brick`, `ghc`, `vty`, and Vty platform packages will be
   the most important ones.

 - Clearly describe the behavior you expected ...

 - ... and include a minimal demonstration program that exhibits the
   behavior you actually observed.

Contributing
------------

If you decide to contribute, that's great! Here are some guidelines you
should consider to make submitting patches easier for all concerned:

 - If you want to take on big things, talk to me first; let's have a
   design/vision discussion before you start coding. Create a GitHub
   issue and we can use that as the place to hash things out.
 - Please make changes consistent with the conventions I've used in the
   codebase.
 - Please adjust or provide Haddock and/or user guide documentation
   relevant to any changes you make.
 - Please ensure that commits are `-Wall` clean.
 - Please ensure that each commit makes a single, logical, isolated
   change as much as possible.
 - Please do not submit changes that your linter told you to make. I
   will probably decline them. Relatedly: please do not submit changes
   that change only style without changing functionality.
 - Please do NOT include package version changes in your patches.
   Package version changes are only done at release time when the full
   scope of a release's changes can be evaluated to determine the
   appropriate version change.
